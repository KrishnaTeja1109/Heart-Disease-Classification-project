# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification With Exploratory Data Analysis and Various Classifiers

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making quick and data-driven decisions using patient information.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.
- `Patient_Info.csv` – Dataset containing relevant patient data like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle parameters.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

Each row in `Patient_Info.csv` represents a patient record. Key features include:

- `Age`
- `Sex`
- `ChestPainType`
- `RestingBP` (resting blood pressure)
- `Cholesterol`
- `FastingBS` (fasting blood sugar)
- `RestingECG` (resting electrocardiographic results)
- `MaxHR` (maximum heart rate achieved)
- `ExerciseAngina`
- `Oldpeak`
- `ST_Slope`
- `HeartDisease` (target variable: 1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

---

## 🧪 Models Trained

The following classification models were explored:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---
